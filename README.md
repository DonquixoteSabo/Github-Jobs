## Overview

- Use RTK to cache the data from API
- Use react-testing-library to test redux
- Use MSW to mock API responses and test them
- Use more advanced typescript 
- Handle styles with styled-components
- use Lodash to dynamic update data

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
In the beginning, this site was using GitHub API. Unluckily, this API is no longer available so I was forced to use some kind of service worker to mock the data. That's why this project doesn't work on the production.
To check this project and run all tests you have to copy this repo.
